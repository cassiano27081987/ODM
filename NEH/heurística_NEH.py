### READING THE FILE WITH PROCESS TIMES ###

file = open('dados_NEH.txt','r')  # Open file named work03_NEH.txt
lines = file.readlines()  # Read all file
file.close()  # Close file

Tij = []  # Array to receive the time processes from job i at machine j

for i in range(len(lines)):
    # For each line i from lines, split the content to separator '\t'
    row = lines[i].split()
    row = [int(j) for j in row]  # Convert each character j in row from string to int
    Tij.append(row)  # Append the row i to matrix Tij

print (" The data are: ",Tij)
### NEH ALGORITHM ###

## STEP 1: Calculate the total processing time of each job al all machines ##

Pi = []  # Array to receive the sum_j Tij for all i
A = []  # Array to receive the copy of vector Pi with the time and position
initial_seq = []  # Array to receive the initial sequence

for i in range(len(Tij)):
    Pi.append(sum(Tij[i]))  # Total processing time of each job at all machines

for i in range(len(Tij)):
    x = (i, Pi[i])  # Creates a tuple with the job i and total time processing Pi
    A.append(x)  # Creates an array of tuples

A = Sort_Tuple(A)  # Sort the array A in descending order of Pi

for i in range(len(A)):
    initial_seq.append(A[i][0])  # Takes the position of each job after sorted

## STEP 2: ##
# Evaluate two partial sequences {J1,J2} and {J2, J1} and chosse the one with samaller makespan
#  to be 2-partial sequence ##

Makespan = []  # Array to calculate makespan for each partial sequence
l = list(permutations([initial_seq[0], initial_seq[1]]))  # exchanges two firsts elements of initial_seq
l = [list(i) for i in l]  # list of lists

for i in range(len(l)):
    Makespan.append(makespan(l[i], Tij))  # Calculate makespan for the partial sequences

constraints = [l[Makespan.index(min(Makespan))]]  # Array to maintain the order of the jobs

S = (l[Makespan.index(min(Makespan))])  # 2-partial sequence
S1 = S.copy()

## STEP 3: ##
# As for ( 3,..., ) k J k = n , insert it to k possible places of the (kâˆ’1) -partial solution,
# evaluate the k partial sequences, and choose the one with the smallest makespan
# to be the k partial solution.

for i in range(2, len(initial_seq)):

    S1.insert(1, initial_seq[i])  # Insert k element at the second position of the array S1
    A = list(p[:] for p in constrained_permutations(S1, constraints))  # copy the permutation if you want to keep it
    Makespan = []

    for i in range(len(A)):
        Makespan.append(makespan(A[i], Tij))  # Calculate makespan for the partial sequences

    constraints.append(A[Makespan.index(min(Makespan))])  # Array to maintain the order of the jobs

### Results ###
print("Sequence: ", constraints[-1], "\n")  # The last sequence of constraint is the NEH-sequence
print("Makespan: ", min(Makespan))  # Minimum makespan
print("Completion time: ")
